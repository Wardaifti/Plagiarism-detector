# Plagiarism-detector
A plagiarism detection application developed with Flask, providing a seamless web-based interface for users. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze text, leveraging the Naive Bayes algorithm for accurate classification. Designed for efficiency and ease of use in identifying potential plagiarism.

Collecting the Dataset: The first step in building our plagiarism detector is gathering a comprehensive dataset. The dataset should consist of text documents that contain both original and plagiarized content. You can find such datasets from online sources like Kaggle or create your own by manually collecting documents.

Here, we use a hypothetical dataset containing pairs of text where each pair includes one original document and one plagiarized version. This dataset will help train our machine learning model to distinguish between original and copied content.

Preprocessing the Data
Before feeding the data into our machine learning model, we need to preprocess it. Preprocessing steps include:

Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.

Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

Removing Punctuation: Eliminating punctuation marks to avoid treating them as words.

Stopwords Removal: Removing common words like "and", "the", etc., that do not contribute to the meaning of the text.

Building the Machine Learning Model:

We use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features. Then, we train a model using these features. For this example, we will use naive bayes model.

Creating the Flask Web Application:

To make our plagiarism detector easily accessible, we create a Flask web application. This application will provide a user interface where users can input two text documents and receive a plagiarism score.
